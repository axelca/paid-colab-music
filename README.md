## Installation

For now you need to install dependecies in all sub folders, you need the spotify-client who recieves data, the ipad-client who sends data, the socket-server who transmits the data and the auth-server for authorizing towards Spotify.

`cd spotify-client`

`npm i`

`cd ipad-client`

`npm i`

`cd socket-server`

`npm i`

`cd auth-server`

`npm i`

## Running

Running the code is done with either:

`npm start`

or:

`node app.js`

It depends on if thereÂ´s pre defined scripts in each folder, sorry it has been a stressful project so far.
